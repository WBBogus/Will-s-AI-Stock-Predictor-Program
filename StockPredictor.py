data = stock.history(period=predictionPeriod) # get the last how many years of data.

# Since data returns a DataFrame where the date is the index instead of being a regular column. We need to move the index back into a column.
# this is important because Prophet requires a ds (date) column explicitly. If the date remains as an index, Prophet won't be able to recognize it.

# yfinance provides many columns (Open, High, Low, Volume, etc.), but we only need Date and Close Price for prediction. 
# Prophet has strict requirements for column names. ds is the dateime column and y is the numerical value prophet will predict which is stock price.
# so we must rename the Date and Close columns to ds and y respectively.

# Prophet does not support time zones in the ds column, yfinance returns timestamps with time zones which causes errors.
# to fix this we must remove the timezone so Prophet accepts the ds column.

# Reset index and prepare data for Prophet
data.reset_index(inplace=True) # moves the index (which contains the dates) back into a regular column.
